algorithmicProblems
===================

Some solutions of algorithmic problems in Scala, Java and Python (2.7 to match Codility's version). The problems come from CodinGame, Project Euler, Codility and CodeEval.

CodinGame problems are on average reasonably hard/interesting, they often include pathfinding and sometimes lead to a quite longer code than the other challenges.
Project Euler proposes the more mathematical-based problems, the goal is most often to find mathematical tricks to reduce the space of solutions. The first problems are fairly easy but difficulty increases pretty quickly.
Codility problems are purely algorithmic. The average difficulty of the respectable problems is quite high.
CodeEval easy problems are most often completely trivial, and I'll be soon starting the moderate ones.

- NB1 : For Codility, I will share the code both of the training problems (in the *lessonX* folders) and challenges I participated to.

===================
- CodinGame (http://www.codingame.com/cg/) is a french website dedicated to programming freaks which proposes problems of increasing difficulty.

- Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that every math and algorithmic lover must visit. To this date, more than 470 problems have been released, giving a hard time to thousands of programers. Most of these problems are math-oriented and require good skills both in math and programming.

- Codility (https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/) is a website that proposes some algorithmic lessons and exercises. It also provides a nice in-browser IDE and offers its services to company recruiters to test their candidates on Codility's platform.

- CodeEval (https://www.codeeval.com) is a website that proposes algorithmic challenges of various difficulties and have a nice ranking/progression system.
