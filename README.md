algorithmicProblems
===================

Some solutions of algorithmic problems in Scala, Java and Python (2.7 to match Codility's version). The problems come from CodinGame, Project Euler, Codility, CodeEval, HackerRank and some of them don't have a specific source.

- **CodinGame** problems are on average reasonably hard/interesting, they often include pathfinding and sometimes lead to a quite longer code than the other challenges.

- **Project Euler** proposes the more mathematical-based problems, the goal is most often to find mathematical tricks to reduce the space of solutions. The first problems are fairly easy but difficulty increases pretty quickly.

- **Codility** problems are purely algorithmic. The average difficulty of the respectable problems is quite high.

- **CodeEval** problems are generally trivial or easy whatever their difficuly category, however some of them are interesting. Yet, it was overall a way for me to train my Python and Scala.

- **HackerRank:** very good website with a broad range of core computer science problems (as opposed to website like CodinGame that are more gamified) ranging from easy to hard. Good for learning about some data structures that aren't frequently used or specific algorithms/set of problems.

- **Interviewbit:** not all problems are interesting, but the website is pretty well-designed and useful to people who wish to train for coding/problem solving interviews. The problems labeled witht he name of a big tech company (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft) are very useful to train. The website also has nice functionalities that I didn't see on many websites like system design questions and even mock interviews with other members of the website. Pretty cool.

- **Miscellaneous:** this folder contains random work I've been doing on my own. Not all of it is complete/refined, but I like keeping track of it.

===================
- CodinGame (http://www.codingame.com/cg/) is a french website dedicated to programming freaks which proposes problems of increasing difficulty.

- Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that every math and algorithmic lover must visit. To this date, more than 470 problems have been released, giving a hard time to thousands of programers. Most of these problems are math-oriented and require good skills both in math and programming.

- Codility (https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/) is a website that proposes some algorithmic lessons and exercises. It also provides a nice in-browser IDE and offers its services to company recruiters to test their candidates on Codility's platform.

- CodeEval (https://www.codeeval.com) is a website that proposes algorithmic challenges of various difficulties and have a nice ranking/progression system.

- HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com) is a website that organizes various algorithmic challenges. It's a very good resource for developping one's algorithmic abilities.

- Interviewbit (https://www.interviewbit.com/) is a website that is heavily focused on providing an interview-like experience. It covers a large variety of coding problems and system design questions. Good resource for preparing interviews.
