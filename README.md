algorithmicProblems
===================

Some solutions of algorithmic problems in Scala, Java and Python (2.7 to match Codility's version). The problems come from CodinGame, Project Euler, Codility and CodeEval.

- NB1 : For Codility, I will share the code both of the training problems (in the *lessonX* folders) and challenges I participated to. 
- NB2 : For CodeEval, I have solved all the easy problems but did not include them as they are pretty basic.

===================
- CodinGame (http://www.codingame.com/cg/) is a french website dedicated to programming freaks which proposes problems of increasing difficulty.

- Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that every math and algorithmic lover must visit. To this date, more than 470 problems have been released, giving a hard time to thousands of programers. Most of these problems are math-oriented and require good skills both in math and programming.

- Codility (https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/) is a website that proposes some algorithmic lessons and exercises. It also provides a nice in-browser IDE and offers its services to company recruiters to test their candidates on Codility's platform.

- CodeEval (https://www.codeeval.com) is a website that proposes algorithmic challenges of various difficulties and have a nice ranking/progression system.
