algorithmicProblems
===================

Some solutions of algorithmic problems in Scala, Java and Python (2.7 to match Codility's version). The problems come from CodinGame, Project Euler, Codility, CodeEval, HackerRank and some of them don't have a specific source.

- **CodinGame** problems are on average reasonably hard/interesting, they often include pathfinding and sometimes lead to a quite longer code than the other challenges.

- **Project Euler** proposes the more mathematical-based problems, the goal is most often to find mathematical tricks to reduce the space of solutions. The first problems are fairly easy but difficulty increases pretty quickly.

- **Codility** problems are purely algorithmic. The average difficulty of the respectable problems is quite high.

- **CodeEval** problems are generally trivial or easy whatever their difficuly category, however some of them are interesting. Yet, it was overall a way for me to train my Python and Scala.

- **HackerRank:** Can't say anything yet, I haven't tried enough problems from there to judge them.

===================
- CodinGame (http://www.codingame.com/cg/) is a french website dedicated to programming freaks which proposes problems of increasing difficulty.

- Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/) is a website that every math and algorithmic lover must visit. To this date, more than 470 problems have been released, giving a hard time to thousands of programers. Most of these problems are math-oriented and require good skills both in math and programming.

- Codility (https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/) is a website that proposes some algorithmic lessons and exercises. It also provides a nice in-browser IDE and offers its services to company recruiters to test their candidates on Codility's platform.

- CodeEval (https://www.codeeval.com) is a website that proposes algorithmic challenges of various difficulties and have a nice ranking/progression system.

- HackerRank (https://www.hackerrank.com) is a website that organizes various algorithmic challenges.
