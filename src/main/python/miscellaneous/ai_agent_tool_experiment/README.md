# Context

The below records my interaction with q chat using claude-3.7-sonnet, just playing around with creating custom tools and see how well it's able to use them. I have made it generate both the tool and the mock data it works with, and I brought minor manual modifications to the tool's code and documentation. 

# Data generation

please generate a CSV file which contains mock data for a bank account statement. We will have the following columns: date of the transaction, name of the recipient or sender, amount transferred (positive or negative). 50 lines will be enough. You can reuse the same recipient/sender a few times to make the data interesting, and for dates you can span across 6 months starting from Janurary 2025. Make sure to spread them out a little bit. You can name the file mock-statement.tsv

# Tool generation

- now please generate a Python tool that uses this file to answer some basic questions and return the response in JSON. We'll have the following features: filtering by date, by month, by recipient/sender, by debit or credit. All of these filters can be combined. The input of the tool is also JSON. It takes a list of filters, and for each filter there's a type and a query. The types are DATE, MONTH, RECIPIENT_OR_SENDER, DEBIT, CREDIT.

- can you please read bank_statement_analyzer.py and modify it to accept date ranges (or month ranges)? Andyou should update the documentation as well. Please also update the documentation to specify what is and isn't possible with the tool, so that later the LLM won't try things tha
t are not supported. Also, let's add an error message when the user attempts passing multiple filters of the same type

- I'd also like you to specify the correct date format (yyyy-MM-dd for dates and yyyy-MM for months) in the document
ation and validate it in the code. There should also be a validation that the second date in the range is larger (or equal to) than the first.

# Tool usage

- Hi, I would like you to act like a mock accounting assistant. To query the fake bank statements, you have a tool at your disposal which allows returning all the transactions, in JSON, after applying a number of filters. You should always run `./bank_statement_analyzer.py -h` once at the beginning of a session to get a comprehensive view of how the tool works, but you need to do this only once. Going forward, I will ask you some questions and you will run the tool to answer them, expliciting every time which query you have used. Are you ready?

- please tell me which merchants I have bought from between March and June 2025. I want just the de-duplicated list for the whole period. Thanks!

- based on my expenses in the last 3 months (we are in July 2025), what do you think would help me save money? Any suggestion?
