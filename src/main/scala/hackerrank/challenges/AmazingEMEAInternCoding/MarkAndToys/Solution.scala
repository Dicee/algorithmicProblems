// Difficulty: medium. There's a trivial naive solution, which can be refined in a more subtle solution.

/**
 * Implementation note:
 *
 * Of course, a trivial way to solve the problem is to sort the list of prices and to iterate from the lowest
 * element to the highest until the sum of the explored elements exceeds the total budget.
 *
 * However, although the worst case complexity of my solution is the same as for such naive solution, it will
 * perform much better when the budget only allows to buy a small subset of items or simply when there are a
 * huge number of items.
 *
 * The main win will be memory-wise since my solution avoids storing all the elements and just streams over them.
 * In extreme cases where there are a lot of very expensive items (relative to the budget), my solution will also
 * avoid a lot of comparisons since it won't even try to insert them in the queue.
